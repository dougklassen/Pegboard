# Pegboard

An addin project to organize my collection of Revit helper commands and quickly test new tools.
Project configurations can be used to build and deploy for multiple Revit versions.

This add in will add a tab to the ribbon with access to the different commands contained in it.

Commands have been copied from a past project which supported Revit versions through 2024.
This project will support versions from 2025 onwards, following the Revit API's transition to .NET 8.
